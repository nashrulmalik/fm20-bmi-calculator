            <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
            <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight'. Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim to eat a balanced and nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, aiming for about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
            <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific factors, such as body composition, age, and ethnicity, can influence BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.</p>
